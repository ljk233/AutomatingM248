## Ideas

- Poisson process (WIP)
- Home teams score more goals than away teams
  - H0 : Hg = Ag
  - H1 : Hg > Ag
- Goals are uniformly scored over the 90 minute period (WIP)
  - Chi-sq goodness of fit
- Home team is more likely to score fist
  - Need data
    - game, first goals, team
- Teams are conceding more goals
  - Average Goals score 2018/19 = Average Goals score 2019/20
- Covid and loss of the home of the home team advantage
  - Proportion Home wins (201819) = Proportion Home wins (2020/21)
  - Missing data 2020/21
