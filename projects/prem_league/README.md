## Notebooks

- Poisson process (WIP)
- Goals are uniformly scored over the 90 minute period (WIP)
- Home teams score more goals than away teams

## Ideas

- Home team is more likely to score fist
  - Need data: `game`, `first_goals`, `team`
- Teams are conceding more goals
  - Average Goals score 2018/19 = Average Goals score 2019/20
- Covid and loss of the home of the home team advantage
  - Proportion Home wins (201819) = Proportion Home wins (2020/21)
  - Missing data 2020/21
