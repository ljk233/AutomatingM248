# Data Visualisations in Python

The unit covers a few means to visualise data,[^1] and also teaches how they can be carried out in Minitab.[^2]
This a structure note that outlines various activities in Computer Book A that were completed in Python using the seaborn package.[^4]

## Bar charts

- [Bar charts of raw data](../Exercises/comp_a1_04_bar_charts.md)[^3]
- [Bar charts of summarised data](../Exercises/comp_a1_05_bar_charts.md)[^3]
- [Side-by-side bar charts](../Exercises/comp_a4_16_side_by_side_bar_charts.md)[^5]

## Histograms

- Frequency histograms
- Relative frequency histograms
- Unit-area histograms

## Boxplots
