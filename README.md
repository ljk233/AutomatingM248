Well that's the module completed.
The repo got away from me in the end, so I plan to archive it soon.
I think it's because it turned into a guide on how to use the packages, rather than any meaningful statistics, which I guess isn't that interesting.

I undertook a large refactoring exercise, leaving a large folder of archived notebooks that contain a lot of duplicated work.
I should work through these to remove what is not needed.
