Well that's the module completed.
The repo got away from me in the end, so I plan to archive it soon after some more refactoring for posterities sake.

  - [x] `data`
  - [X] `docs`

I undertook a large refactoring exercise, leaving a large folder of archived notebooks that contain a lot of duplicated work.
I should work through these to remove what is not needed.
