Default is True.\n    alternative : {None, 'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional\n        Defines the alternative hypothesis.\n        The following options are available (default is None):\n    \n          * None: computes p-value half the size of the 'two-sided' p-value and\n            a different U statistic. The default behavior is not the same as\n            using 'less' or 'greater'; it only exists for backward compatibility\n            and is deprecated.\n          * 'two-sided'\n          * 'less': one-sided\n          * 'greater': one-sided\n    \n        Use of the None option is deprecated.\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    statistic : float\n        The Mann-Whitney U statistic, equal to min(U for x, U for y) if\n        `alternative` is equal to None (deprecated; exists for backward\n        compatibility), and U for y otherwise.\n    pvalue : float\n        p-value assuming an asymptotic normal distribution. One-sided or\n        two-sided, depending on the choice of `alternative`.\n    \n    Notes\n    -----\n    Use only when the number of observation in each sample is > 20 and\n    you have 2 independent samples of ranks. Mann-Whitney U is\n    significant if the u-obtained is LESS THAN or equal to the critical\n    value of U.\n    \n    This test corrects for ties and by default uses a continuity correction.\n    \n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
