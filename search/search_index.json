Checking the validity of a probability function Use case: We are given some probability distribution (either a probability mass function or a p.d.f.), and we are asked to confirm it is valid. Workflow: Check if the properties hold true. For a discrete rv \\(\\sum_x p(x) = 1\\) \\(p(x) \\in (0,1]\\) for a continuous rv \\(\\int f(x) = 1\\) , over the range of \\(x\\) \\(f(x) \\in (0,1)\\) Standard probability models Use case : We are given a scenario, and asked to calculate the probability of some event. Workflow : Identify the distribution Map the parameters Parse the probabilities Solve the equation(s) State the solution, and the level of any approximation Example . EasyAir charters 15 flights each day from Cardiff to Narnia. It has been reported by cabin crew that sky mermaids are spotted during 40% of flights. For a particular day, calculate the probability that 9 flights will spot sky mermaids. calculate the probability that less than 3 flights will spot sky mermaids. Identify the distribution. This scenario is described a binomial distribution, \\(B(n,p)\\) . Map the parameters. There are 15 flights, so \\(n=15\\) ; and 40% of flights spot sky mermaids, so \\(p=0.4\\) ; thus \\(B(15, 0.4)\\) . Parse the probabilities. For (1) \" Exactly 9 \" is \\(P(X=9) = p(9)\\) ; and for (2) \" Less than 3 \" is \\(P(X<3) = P(X \\leq 2) = F(2)\\) Solve the equations (See HB pp.26 for the need formulae). For (1) \\(p(9) \\backsimeq 0.06121\\) . And for (2) \\(F(2) = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) \\backsimeq 0.02711\\) . State the solutions, and the level of approximation. Calculating population quantiles in the continuous case Use case : We are given a p.d.f. \\(f(x)\\) or c.d.f. \\(F(x)\\) , and asked to calculate some \\(\\alpha-\\) quantile of the distribution. Workflow : If needed, find the c.d.f. by integrating \\(F(x) = \\int_{a}^{x} f(y) dy\\) . Identify the needed quantile in terms of a \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\) . Solve \\(q_{\\alpha} = F^{-1}(\\alpha)\\) . Example : The c.d.f. of a random variable \\(X\\) is given by \\[ F(x) = \\frac{1}{8} (x^{2} - 1), \\hspace{3mm} x \\in 1,3). \\] Calculate lower quartile of \\(X\\) . Find the c.d.f.

Workflow : Formalise the rate \\(\\lambda\\) . Pay attention to the unit of time. Determine the rate \\(\\lambda t\\) of the scenario. It will be \\(\\lambda\\) if the events are being modelled over the same time interval , and it will \\(\\lambda t\\) if it is a different time interval. Parse the probability . Number of events \\(X\\) . Use \\(X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda t)\\) Waiting time \\(T\\) between events . Use \\(T \\sim M(\\lambda)\\) . Example. Suppose that alpha particles are emitted from a radioactive source at random at an average rate of 0.5 every second. Assume that the emissions of alpha particles may be modelled by a Poisson process. Calculate the probability that more than 3 alpha particles will be emitted within a 5 second window. Calculate the probability that the waiting time between emissions of alpha particles exceeds ten seconds. Formalise the rate \\(\\lambda\\) . The rate \\(\\lambda\\) is 0.5 per second. Determine the rate for the timeframe. Alpha particle emissions may be modelled by a Poisson process with rate \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\) per second. So \\(X\\) , the number of emissions in a five-second interval, will have a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda t = 0.5(5) = 2.5\\) . Parse the probability. For (1) \"More than 3\" is \\(P(X>3) = 1 - P(X \\leq 3)\\) . And for (2) \"Exceeds 10\" is \\(P(T>10) = 1 - P(T \\leq 10) = 1 - F(10)\\) . Solve the equations .
