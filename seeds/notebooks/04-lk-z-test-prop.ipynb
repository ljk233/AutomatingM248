      "Help on function proportions_ztest in module statsmodels.stats.proportion:\n\nproportions_ztest(count, nobs, value=None, alternative='two-sided', prop_var=False)\n    Test for proportions based on normal (z) test\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    count : {int, array_like}\n        the number of successes in nobs trials. If this is array_like, then\n        the assumption is that this represents the number of successes for\n        each independent sample\n    nobs : {int, array_like}\n        the number of trials or observations, with the same length as\n        count.\n    value : float, array_like or None, optional\n        This is the value of the null hypothesis equal to the proportion in the\n        case of a one sample test. In the case of a two-sample test, the\n        null hypothesis is that prop[0] - prop[1] = value, where prop is the\n        proportion in the two samples. If not provided value = 0 and the null\n        is prop[0] = prop[1]\n    alternative : str in ['two-sided', 'smaller', 'larger']\n        The alternative hypothesis can be either two-sided or one of the one-\n        sided tests, smaller means that the alternative hypothesis is\n        ``prop < value`` and larger means ``prop > value``. In the two sample\n        test, smaller means that the alternative hypothesis is ``p1 < p2`` and\n        larger means ``p1 > p2`` where ``p1`` is the proportion of the first\n        sample and ``p2`` of the second one.\n    prop_var : False or float in (0, 1)\n        If prop_var is false, then the variance of the proportion estimate is\n        calculated based on the sample proportion. Alternatively, a proportion\n        can be specified to calculate this variance. Common use case is to\n        use the proportion under the Null hypothesis to specify the variance\n        of the proportion estimate.\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    zstat : float\n        test statistic for the z-test\n    p-value : float\n        p-value for the z-test\n    \n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> count = 5\n    >>> nobs = 83\n    >>> value = .05\n    >>> stat, pval = proportions_ztest(count, nobs, value)\n    >>> print('{0:0.3f}'.format(pval))\n    0.695\n    \n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest\n    >>> count = np.array([5, 12])\n    >>> nobs = np.array([83, 99])\n    >>> stat, pval = proportions_ztest(count, nobs)\n    >>> print('{0:0.3f}'.format(pval))\n    0.159\n    \n    Notes\n    -----\n    This uses a simple normal test for proportions. It should be the same as\n    running the mean z-test on the data encoded 1 for event and 0 for no event\n    so that the sum corresponds to the count.\n    \n    In the one and two sample cases with two-sided alternative, this test\n    produces the same p-value as ``proportions_chisquare``, since the\n    chisquare is the distribution of the square of a standard normal\n    distribution.\n\n"
