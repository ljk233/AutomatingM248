  - **z**-test
    - [X] ... of a population mean (**EPL-goals-208**)
    - [X] ... of a population proportion **(CB.Ex.7)**
    - [ ] ... of the difference between population means (-)
  - **t**-test
    - [X] ... of a population mean (`m248.b.ex6`)
    - [ ] ... of the difference between population means (`coins`)
  - Non-parametric
    - [X] Wilcoxon signed rank test
      - [X] One sample **(CB.Ex.7)**
      - [X] two sample **(CB.Ex.7)**
    - [X] Mann-Whitney test (**Tattoos**)
    - [ ] Chi-squared Goodness-of-fit (**EPL-uniform-goals**)
